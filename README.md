Matrix Mosaics, orignally a small project designed for my Linear Algebra Module at UoG, is a simple HTML Page (with accompanying script and styling) that uses grids of coloured squares to demonstrate the effects different Matrix Operations have on a Matrix. 

Featues Include:
• Custom Matrix Sizes anywhere between 1X1 to 10X10 for 100 Different possible Matrix Sizes. 
• Play with your creations with Matrix Operations, including Inversion, Rotation, and Scaling.
• Watch your Art change in realtime as you rotate your Matrix.
• Learn more about Matrices with provided definitons, explainations, and examples. 
• Over 90 Million different possible Mosaic creations!
